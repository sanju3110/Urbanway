# Urbanway Metro Project

## Overview
The Urbanway Metro Project is designed to optimize metro routes efficiently using advanced algorithms and data structures. The project features route optimization through Dijkstra's algorithm and a custom Heap data structure, along with a user-friendly console interface for seamless route navigation.

## Features
- **Route Optimization**: Calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- **Custom Heap**: Enhance performance with a tailored Heap data structure.
- **Console Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tool for route information.

## Development Environment
- **IDE**: Eclipse IDE for development and debugging.
- **Setup**: Import the project into Eclipse using `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`.

## Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: Main application script.
- **`dijkstra.py`**: Implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- **`heap.py`**: Custom Heap data structure code.
